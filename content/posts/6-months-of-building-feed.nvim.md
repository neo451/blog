+++

Half a year ago, a regular afternoon, While waiting for Black Myth Wukong downloading, I got struck by an idea that ate away my free time for the next 6 months.

Having just play with Emacs the day before and was pretty amazed with the elegance of the [elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed), but disappointed that I could not find an neovim alternative. I decided to build one myself.

## Neovim is just superior

being a newbie

### Tree-sitter + vim.lpeg + vim.json

json for free lol

### UI framework

- input/select
- progress
- tree
- zenmode

### Picker Powers

### Just in case you have not realized, we have libuv

## Pandoc is awesome

failed to write my own, still could be though...

- markdown render plugins
- export to any note taking plugins
- TODO: markup as config

## Building my curl wrapper is fun

- little shit on plenary lol.
